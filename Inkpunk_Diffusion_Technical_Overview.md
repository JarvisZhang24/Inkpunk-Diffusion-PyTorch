# Inkpunk Diffusion: Technical Implementation Overview

## Project Introduction

This project presents a complete from-scratch PyTorch implementation of Inkpunk-style Stable Diffusion v1.5, demonstrating hands-on expertise with diffusion models, attention-based UNet architectures, CLIP text encoding, and VAE image compression. The implementation features clean, readable code with reproducible results across CUDA, Apple Silicon (MPS), and CPU platforms.

## System Architecture

## Core Components Overview

The system consists of four primary neural network components that work in harmony to transform text descriptions into high-quality images:

- **CLIP Text Encoder**: Converts natural language into semantic vector representations
- **UNet Denoiser**: Iteratively removes noise from latent representations guided by text context
- **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**: Handles compression/decompression between image and latent spaces
- **DDPM Sampler**: Controls the denoising schedule and sampling process

## Detailed Technical Walkthrough

### Example Generation: "nvinkpunk cyberpunk samurai with neon mask, glowing swords"

Let's trace through a complete generation process with specific parameters:

**Input Configuration:**
- Positive prompt: `"nvinkpunk cyberpunk samurai with neon mask, glowing swords"`
- Negative prompt: `"blurry, low resolution, deformed hands"`
- Inference steps: 80
- Image resolution: 512×512 pixels
- CFG scale: 7.5

## Phase 1: Text Encoding Pipeline (CLIP)

### 1.1 Tokenization Process

The **CLIPTokenizer** converts raw text into numerical sequences:

```
Input Text → Tokenization → Token IDs
Shape transformation: String → [1, 77] integer tensor
```

**Key Features:**
- Fixed sequence length of 77 tokens (padding/truncation applied)
- Special tokens include start-of-sequence and end-of-sequence markers
- Vocabulary size: 49,408 tokens
- Unused positions filled with padding tokens

### 1.2 CLIP Text Encoder Architecture

The **CLIP class** implements a transformer-based text encoder with three main components:

#### CLIPEmbedding Layer
```
Token IDs → Word Embeddings + Positional Embeddings
Shape: [1, 77] → [1, 77, 768]
```
- Converts each token ID to a 768-dimensional dense vector
- Adds learnable positional embeddings to encode sequence order
- Vocabulary embedding matrix: [49,408 × 768]

#### 12-Layer Transformer Stack
Each **CLIPLayer** contains:
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Enables tokens to attend to each other with causal masking
- **Feed-Forward Network**: 4× expansion ratio (768 → 3072 → 768)
- **Layer Normalization**: Applied before each sub-layer (Pre-LN architecture)
- **QuickGELU Activation**: `x * sigmoid(1.702 * x)` for efficient computation

```
After 12 transformer layers:
Shape maintained: [1, 77, 768]
Semantic richness: Significantly enhanced
```

#### Final Output Processing
```
Final text embeddings: [1, 77, 768]
- Batch dimension: 1
- Sequence length: 77 (fixed)
- Feature dimension: 768
```

For Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), both positive and negative prompts are encoded and concatenated:
```
Concatenated context: [2, 77, 768]
```

## Phase 2: Latent Space Initialization

### 2.1 Latent Space Configuration

To achieve computational efficiency, the system operates in a compressed latent space rather than directly on pixel values:

```
Image Space: 512×512×3 = 786,432 values
Latent Space: 64×64×4 = 16,384 values (48× reduction)
```

### 2.2 Noise Initialization

```python
# Generate pure Gaussian noise in latent space
Initial noise shape: [1, 4, 64, 64]
Distribution: Standard normal N(0, 1)
```

---

## Phase 3: Iterative Denoising Process (UNet + DDPM)

This constitutes the core generative process, involving 80 iterative denoising steps:

### 3.1 DDPM Sampler Configuration

```python
# Timestep schedule setup
Total training steps: 1000
Inference steps: 80
Timestep sequence: [999, 987, 975, ..., 12, 0]
Beta schedule: Linear from 0.00085 to 0.012
```

### 3.2 Per-Step Denoising Process

#### Step 1: Time Embedding Generation
```
Current timestep → Sinusoidal time embedding
Shape: scalar → [1, 320]
```

The `get_time_embedding()` function employs sinusoidal positional encoding to inform the model about the current denoising stage.

#### Step 2: UNet Noise Prediction

The **UNet architecture** implements a U-shaped neural network with skip connections:

##### Time Embedding Processing
```
TimeEmbedding class:
[1, 320] → [1, 1280] via two linear layers with SiLU activation
```

##### Encoder Path (Downsampling)
```
Input latent: [1, 4, 64, 64]
├── Layer 1: [1, 4, 64, 64] → [1, 320, 64, 64] (Initial conv)
├── Layer 2: ResBlock + Attention → [1, 320, 64, 64]
├── Layer 3: ResBlock + Attention → [1, 320, 64, 64]
├── Layer 4: Downsample → [1, 320, 32, 32]
├── Layer 5: ResBlock + Attention → [1, 640, 32, 32]
├── Layer 6: ResBlock + Attention → [1, 640, 32, 32]
├── Layer 7: Downsample → [1, 640, 16, 16]
├── Layer 8: ResBlock + Attention → [1, 1280, 16, 16]
├── Layer 9: ResBlock + Attention → [1, 1280, 16, 16]
└── Layer 10: Downsample → [1, 1280, 8, 8]
```

##### Bottleneck Processing
```
Middle block: [1, 1280, 8, 8]
Components: ResBlock → Attention → ResBlock
```

##### Decoder Path (Upsampling)
```
Starting from: [1, 1280, 8, 8]
Skip connections from corresponding encoder layers
Progressive upsampling back to: [1, 320, 64, 64]
```

##### Final Noise Prediction
```
UNET_OutputLayer:
[1, 320, 64, 64] → [1, 4, 64, 64]
Output: Predicted noise tensor
```

#### Critical Subcomponent Analysis

##### UNET_ResidualBlock
```
Purpose: Feature processing with time conditioning
Inputs: Feature maps + Time embeddings
Process:
1. Group normalization + SiLU activation
2. Convolutional feature processing
3. Time embedding linear transformation and integration
4. Second normalization + activation + convolution
5. Residual connection
```

##### UNET_AttentionBlock
```
Purpose: Cross-modal attention between image and text
Inputs: Image features [B, C, H, W] + Text context [B, 77, 768]
Process:
1. Self-attention: Spatial relationships within image features
2. Cross-attention: Image-text correspondence modeling
3. Feed-forward processing with GeGLU activation
Output: Text-conditioned image features
```

#### Step 3: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)
When CFG is enabled:
```
Model predicts noise for both conditions:
- Conditional noise (guided by positive prompt)
- Unconditional noise (guided by negative prompt)

Final noise = cfg_scale × (conditional - unconditional) + unconditional
```

This mechanism enhances prompt adherence while avoiding negative prompt characteristics.

#### Step 4: Noise Removal
```
DDPM sampler step() function:
Current latent + Predicted noise → Slightly denoised latent
```

The sampler employs mathematical formulations from the DDPM paper to compute the previous timestep's latent representation.

### 3.3 80-Step Iteration Progression

```
Step 0: Pure noise [1, 4, 64, 64]
Step 10: Emergence of basic shapes
Step 30: Structure clarification
Step 50: Detail development
Step 80: Fully denoised latent representation
```

## Phase 4: Image Reconstruction (VAE Decoder)

### 4.1 VAE Decoder Architecture

The final latent representation requires conversion back to RGB image format:

```
Input latent: [1, 4, 64, 64]
```

#### Scaling Adjustment
```python
# Remove encoder scaling factor
x = x / 0.18215
```

#### Decoder Network Hierarchy
```
[1, 4, 64, 64]
├── Initial conv: → [1, 512, 64, 64]
├── ResBlocks × 3 + Attention
├── Upsample: → [1, 512, 128, 128] (2× scale)
├── ResBlocks × 3
├── Upsample: → [1, 512, 256, 256] (2× scale)
├── ResBlocks × 3
├── Upsample: → [1, 256, 512, 512] (2× scale)
├── ResBlocks × 3
├── Group norm + SiLU activation
└── Final conv: → [1, 3, 512, 512]
```

#### Post-processing Pipeline
```
Pixel range conversion: [-1, 1] → [0, 255]
Dimension reordering: [1, 3, 512, 512] → [1, 512, 512, 3]
Data type conversion: float32 → uint8
```
